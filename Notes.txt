STEPS TO IMPLEMENT DATABASE CRUD IN API

STEP1: Create model(s)
STEP 2: Create DbContext class
STEP 2.1: a DbContext class must inherit from DbcContext which is found in Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
STEP 2.2: Install the following packages if they are not installed
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
			- Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
		NOTICE!!: the versions installed must aggree with your version of .net framework which can be found by 
		right clicking on frameworks under dependencies and then right click on microsft.aspnetcore.app
		and choosing properties which will display the version of the freame work you are using.

		NOTICE!!: Ensure that you check if your namespace or project name does not have the same name as your model.
					If it does you would either have to change the name of your model or use the namespace, the floder name and
					the name of your model . Example: Attraction.Models.Attraction
					where Attraction in the namespace, and the model is also Attraction and it is
					located in the model folder.

STEP 3: Set up the connection string

		 NameOfConnectionString : "Server=NameofServer; Initial Catalog=NameofDataBase; Trusted_Connection=True; TrustServerCertificate=True;"

STEP 4: Add DbContextOptions to the middleware pipeline in Program.cs

STEP 5: Initiate the Migration and create the table in the database.

STEP 5.1: The command to run in nuget manager console are 

		- Add-Migration "NameofMigration/Comment"
